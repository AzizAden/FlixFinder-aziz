## Finding Flix - Tinder for Movies

## Description

Finding Flix is a web based application that aims to simplify the process of finding your new favorite movie. With so many options to watch and a slew of streaming platforms to choose from, Finding Flix attempts to streamline & simplfy these choices for users. 

Users can select a genre of their choice, once chosen the user will be shown a card stack of potential matches, which they can swipe through to either "match" with or disregard. Once the user has swiped through all of their cards, their matches will be stored in a list displayed to them that will also display where the user can view the program.
